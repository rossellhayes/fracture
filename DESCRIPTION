Description: Provides functions for converting decimals to a
    matrix of numerators and denominators or a character vector of
    fractions.  Supports mixed or improper fractions, finding common
    denominators for vectors of fractions, limiting denominators to powers
    of ten, and limiting denominators to a maximum value.  Also includes
    helper functions for finding the least common multiple and greatest
    common divisor for a vector of integers.  Implemented using C++ for
    maximum speed.
