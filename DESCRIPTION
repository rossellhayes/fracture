Description: Provides functions for converting decimals to a matrix of
    numerators and denominators or a character vector of fractions.
    Supports mixed or improper fractions, finding common denominators for
    vectors of fractions, limiting denominators to powers of ten, and
    limiting denominators to a maximum value.  Also includes helper
    functions for finding the least common multiple and greatest common
    divisor for a vector of integers.  Implemented using C++ for maximum
    speed.
