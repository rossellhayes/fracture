\title{fracture: Convert Decimals to Fractions}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: align='right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Provides functions for converting decimals to a matrix of numerators and denominators or a character vector of fractions. Supports mixed or improper fractions, finding common denominators for vectors of fractions, limiting denominators to powers of ten, and limiting denominators to a maximum value. Also includes helper functions for finding the least common multiple and greatest common divisor for a vector of integers. Implemented using C++ for maximum speed.
